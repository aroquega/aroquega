### My name is Hristo Roque

I'm a fullstack developer and I'm currently studying System Engineering at UNSA University in Arequipa. I love to build web user interfaces in React, and backend applications with .NET and Django.

**Programming Languages** I love and use:

- **Python**, I love its simplicity and builtin features.
- **Javascript**, I love the fact that you can build everything with it.
- **C#**, I love the .NET Core ecosystem 

**Frameworks and Tools** I use:

- **Django**
- **React**
- **ASP.NET Core**

But I can easily work with similar frameworks.
